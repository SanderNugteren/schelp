\section{Representation}

For this problem the amount of times a certain rule was used needed to be
%TODO insert bayes rule for p(rightHandSide|leftHandSide)
represented. Then $$ needs to be computed, so this representation needed easy
access to all rules with the same symbol on the left hand side. Therefore we
chose to use a double hashmap %hashmap or dictionary?
to map the left hand side to a hasmap mapping the right hand side to the amount
of occurences.
